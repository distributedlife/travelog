excerpt: "I barely paused at customs and ended up outside the terminal. I man wandered up and asked if I wanted to buy a CD of The Rolling Stones latest album. It's still in it's plastic wrapper he assured me. I let him know that I didn't have anything to play it. He looked confused and then seemed to remember that iPods existed before wandering off."
